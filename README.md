# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Simple project but very important - first time with SASS!

# Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most important thing I learned in this project was using SASS with BEM methodology and using media queries. Need to focus to using mixins.
